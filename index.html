        <li><h3>Co-Curricular Achievements</h3>
            <p>Co-curricular activities are activities and programs that take place outside of the traditional classroom but in some manner complement academic learning from classroom curriculum. While they do complement what students are learning at school, they are ungraded and do not allow for academic credit to be earned. They can take place outside of school and after regular school hours. Either the school or an outside organization can coordinate co-curricular activities. The purpose of co-curricular activities is to fuel student learning and to build important life skills. Skills built, such as social and leadership skills, can enrich a student's academic experience.</p>

        <li><h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
            <p>Academic achievement describes academic outcomes that indicate the extent to which a student has achieved their learning goals. Academic achievement may refer to completing educational benchmarks such as a high school. Academic achievement is often measured through examinations or continuous assessments. Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which individual factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment, motivation, and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement.</p>
